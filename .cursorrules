This project is a Playwright end-to-end test suite using TypeScript.

General rules:
- Follow Playwright best practices.
- Use Page Object Model.
- Prefer getByRole, getByLabel, getByPlaceholder, or test ids over CSS selectors.
- Avoid arbitrary waits and setTimeout.
- Use explicit, meaningful assertions.

Code style:
- Keep tests readable and deterministic.
- One responsibility per Page Object.
- Do not introduce new abstractions unless explicitly requested.
- Do not refactor unrelated files.

AI behavior:
- Make small, incremental changes.
- Always explain what you changed and why.
- If unsure, ask before making architectural decisions.
